Moonlander, the classic video game

Here is the to do list

- iphone/ipad icons
- initial menu screen
- splash screen
- iphone version
- use floats for X/Y positioning so retina displays are supported
- hardware brochures
- source code viewer
- basic lunar lander game
- get bell code running
- controls have differing brightness
- move dust display code out of main queue
- add data source protocol to VC so we can access data easily
- generate 6x8 dot matrix fonts (if time allows)

Fixed/Done
- views don't implement the correct intensities (lander, flag, etc)
- bug in instruments - blink doesn't reset with new game
- disable all controls after end of game (in nw game dialog)
- dialog button improvement (triggers on buttonUp with buton in focus)
- end game code work (common exit so controls get cleaned up)
- got rid of the palsyTimer and use queues or delay with selector
- run explosion in separate thread
- run model in separate thread (no need for this)
- use animation for moving our guy around - for mcd version calc the animation durations so man moves at constant speed
- fix bug with dust generation
- dust bug (dust appears on rotation)
- angle roundoff - stick with integer angles
- bold/blink selected controls
- on surface, allow indicators to update and slider works as well (roll disabled)
- dust improvements (looks like original)
- explode improvements (account for phosphor decay) 
- implement dust bug when you have no fuel
- explode code implementation
- time runs while on lunar surface - yes
- crashing into an old lander? show lander on top of newly crashed lander
- crashing into a crashed lander? show lander on top of crashed lander
- high speed crash into rock? replace rock with crashed lander and deform
- can flag and old lander be displayed? - yes
- can rock and crashed lander be displayed? - no
- flag replaces rock in database? - yes
- where does man start in lander? - centered in the command module
- old landers are slightly tipped? - yes
- does clock restart after MCD visit? - no
