Moonlander, the classic video game

This branch is for the work on the standalone game as the master
will be getting UI elements making it a pain to test game elements.

Features wish list
===================
- generate 6x8 dot matrix fonts
- throttle dust/thrust updates or at least phosphor age them


Issues to do list
=================
- missing iTunesArtwork@2x (1024x1024)
- complete content for software/hardware/faq/credits/history/controls
- looks like a drawing glitch in the thrust view


Completed
=========
- update delays in modern so speed things up
- increase font size and space out controls for easier access (in classic/modern)
- added intensity control to labels
- Basic UI design implemented
- Added shake gesture to quit a game early
