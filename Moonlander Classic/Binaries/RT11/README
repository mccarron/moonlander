RT11 is used to build Moonlander binaries to run on the GT40 simulator.  Here how it is done:

1. Copy new source files to RT11 disk image using the PUTR utility and the SEND command file.

2. Quit PUTR and copy the RT11 disk image to the RT11 simulator directory

3. Start the RT11 simulator using

     ./pdp11
     
4. Build the sources using the comand file

     $@make.com
     
5. Quit the simulator (Ctrl-E, Q)

6. Copy the RL disk image back to a PC and use the GET command file to retriev the classic (mlc) and debug (mld) versions of Moonlander
