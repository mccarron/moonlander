Three versions of Moonlander are provided to run on simh:

Lunar
=====
This is a version found on the web and distributed with the GT40 simulator.  It is of later vintage and no source code is available for it.

  ./gt40
  
and the .ini file will load and run this version.


Classic
=======
This a working build of the original Moonlander with the dust code removed since it does not appear to be stable.

  ./gt40
  
and the .ini file will load and run this version.

To enable dust you need to restart with the following changes:

  load mlc
  d 1156 1
  run


Debug
=================
This a debug build of the original Moonlander sources, this is the version that I do most testing/comparisons from.

  ./gt40
  
and the .ini file will load but not run this version.  You need to use the run command to start it.

Here are some locations you can patch to set initial conditions:

  .WORD	TURN,-1.			;1630-1632 (degress)
  .WORD	ANGLE,0.			;1634-1636 (degrees)
  .WORD	ANGLER,0			;1640-1642
  .WORD	HORREM,0			;1644-1646
  .WORD	VERREM,0			;1650-1652
  .WORD	HORVEL,0.			;1654-1656 (tenths of FPS, so 10FPS is 100 decimal)
  .WORD	VERVEL,0.			;1660-1662 (tenths of FPS)
  .WORD	HORDIS,-200.		;1664-1666 (feet)
  .WORD	VERDIS,300.			;1670-1672 (feet)
  .WORD	FUEL,FUELS			;1710-1712 (tenths of lbs)

So to set the horizonatal distance to Mcdonalds and disable dust you would use

  d 1666 0
  d 1156 0
  
  
Notes
=====
In case you are wondering, Ctrl-E breaks emulation and 'q' will exit simh.  If you stop the emulator, 'cont' will pick up where you left off.
